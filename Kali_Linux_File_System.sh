/bin/:          basic programs
/boot/:          Kali Linux kernel and other files required for its early boot process
/dev/:           device files
/etc/:           configuration files
/home/:           user's personal files
/lib/:           basic libraries
/media/:           mount points for removable devices (CD/DVD-ROM, USB keys, and so on)
/mnt/:           temporary mount point
/opt/:           extra applications provided by third parties
/root/:           administrator's (root's) personal files
/run/:           volatile runtime data that does not persist across reboots (not yet included in the FHS)
/sbin/:           system programs
/srv/:           data used by servers hosted on this system
/tmp/:           temporary files (this directory is often emptied at boot)
/usr/:           applications (this directory is further subdivided into bin, sbin, lib according to the same logic as in the root directory) Furthermore, /usr/share/ contains architecture-independent data. The /usr/local/ directory is meant to be used by the administrator for installing applications manually without overwriting files handled by the packaging system (dpkg).
/var/:           variable data handled by services. This includes log files, queues, spools, and caches.
/proc/ and /sys/ are specific to the Linux kernel (and not part of the FHS). They are used by the kernel for exporting data to user space.
